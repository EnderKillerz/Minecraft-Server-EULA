  b. Decision-Making and License Alteration

    This section specifies the duty of the License Revocation and License Alteration Council and the process through which all decisions made outside of the specification of the License must be made.

    I) All decisions made outside of License specifications must be decided by the Operators by democratic process.
      i) When deciding the severity of License revocation or privilege de-escalation for Players or Operators who have infringed upon their respective restrictions outside of what is specified by the License, all decisions must be made in the following steps:
        1) The Operator(s) seeking to revoke this License or deescalate the privileges of another Operator must raise their reason and evidence for revocation or privilege de-escalation to the License Revocation and License Alteration Council.
        2) The Operator(s) must raise the claim publicly and accessible to all Operators, gaining the vote of "for" by more than one-half of the entire Moderator team, one member of the Admin team (with no votes against), or the Server Owner in a voting period not lasting less than six hours.
           - In cases involving privilege de-escalation or Temporary or Permanent Denial of Access and Use, the License revocation or privilege de-escalation may be applied immediately and temporarily, although the Operator applying the License revocation or privilege de-escalation may be subject to License revocation or privilege de-escalation if decided by the License Revocation and License Alteration Council to have been an inappropriate use of Operator-level privileges.
           - The Operator(s) raising the claim must abstain from voting.
           - In the case that at least two-thirds of the entire Moderator team votes "against" and one member of the Admin team votes "for" (with no Admin votes "against"), the decision passes as "against".
           - In the case that at least two-thirds of the entire Moderator team votes "for" and one member of the Admin team votes "against" (with no Admin votes "for"), the decision passes as "for".
           - In the case that two Admins vote "against" (with no Admin votes "for"), the decision passes as "against", regardless of the Moderator votes "for".
           - In the case that two Admins vote "for" (with no Admin votes "against"), the decision passes as "for", regardless of the Moderator votes "against".
           - In the case that one Admin votes "for" and one Admin votes "against", both of their votes are nullified, where only one vote nullifies one vote.
           - In the case that at least two-thirds of the Admin team vote "against" and the Server Owner votes "for", the vote passes as "against".
           - In the case that at least two-thirds of the Admin team vote "for" and the Server Owner votes "against", the vote passes as "for".
           - In the case that six hours has passed and not enough votes have been cast to make a decision, the majority vote decides. If there is no majority, the next vote decides.
        3) The Operator(s) who raised the claim must apply the License revocation or privilege de-escalation themselves.
        4) If the License revocation or privilege de-escalation is temporary, the Operator(s) must re-grant the License or re-grant privileges as deemed appropriate by a similar vote.

    II) All decisions on altering the License must be decided by the entire Admin team and Server Owner by democratic process.
      i) When deciding to alter a specific subsection or an entire section of the License, the Moderator, Admin, or Server Owner raising the vote must follow the following process:
        1) The Moderator, Admin, or Server Owner seeking to alter the License must prepare an altered version of the License and make it publicly accessible to all Admins and the Server Owner.
           - In the case that a License alteration does not pass, the License alteration may be altered further in a significant way to compromise with those who voted "against" the change.
        2) The Moderator, Admin, or Server Owner seeking to alter the License must raise their reason and evidence for altering the License and raise a vote in a voting period not lasting less than seven days.
        3) The Moderator, Admin, or Server Owner who raises the vote must gain a vote of "for" by at least two-thirds of the Admin team as well as the vote of "for" by the Server Owner.
           - In the case that the entire Admin team votes "for" and the Server Owner votes "against", the vote passes as "for".
           - In the case that the entire Admin team votes "against" and the Server Owner votes "for", the vote passes as "against".
           - In the case that any less than the entire Admin team votes "for" and the Server Owner votes "against", the vote passes as "against".
           - In the case that any less than the entire Admin team votes "against" and the Server Owner votes "for", the vote passes as "for".
           - In the case that not all members of the Admin team have voted or the Server Owner has not voted, then the voting period must be extended until the point that all Admin have voted.
             = This does not mean that a member voting "against" may delay the process of alteration - if it is believed that an Admin or multiple Admins is/are being purposefully negligent of voting (has not voted within a 14-day period), then the "entire Admin team" may be counted as all members of the Admin team excepting that of the member(s) who have not voted.
        4) The Server Owner must apply the License changes as soon as possible if the vote is "for".
