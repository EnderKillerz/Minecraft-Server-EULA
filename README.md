# Minecraft-Server-EULA
An outlined EULA that should be generally applicable to Minecraft Servers.

# Distribution
Feel free to use this EULA as you see fit. Just replace all necessary information in Section 1 to align with your server, and you're good.

# Need-To-Knows
- This EULA has no legal implication. Since there is no service that a Minecraft server provides which would cause any sort of copyright or piracy law infringement, this EULA serves as a way to outline the rules of the server as well as provide a method of decision-making to servers.
- You may alter this in any way. It has no legal binding and therefore has no need to be approved by an attorney of law.
- **Please give me some credit!** I spent a long time writing this.
